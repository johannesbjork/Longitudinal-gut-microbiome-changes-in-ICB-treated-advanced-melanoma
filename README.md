** fit_pibble_model.R
   * The Logistic-Normal model (as implemented in Pibble, fido package) with three 3-way interactions


  * * R_vs_NR.R
    * Function for computing, from the fitted model, the marginal average for PFS>=12 (R) vs PFS<12 (NR) averaging across all levels of W1 (therapy regimen), W2 (colitis) and W3 (PPI-use), and plotting the posteriors for taxa whose 90% (can be adjusted) credible interval (CI) does not cover 0


  * * R_vs_NR_monotherapy.R
    * Function for computing and plotting the marginal average for PFS12>=12 (R) vs PFS<12 (NR) on monotherapy (W1=0), no colitis (W2=0) and no PPIs (W3=0)


  * * R_vs_NR_combitherapy.R
    * Function for computing and plotting the marginal average for PFS12>=12 (R) vs PFS<12 (NR) on combination therapy (W1=1), no colitis (W2=0) and no PPIs (W3=0)


  * * colitisyes_vs_colitisno.R
    * Function for computing and plotting the marginal average for colitis yes vs no, averaging over Z (PFS12), (therapy regimen) and W3 (PPI-use)

  * * survival_analysis.R 
    * Code for the survival analysis, including the calculation of the longitudinal balance
